_Welcome to_

## Egg Island Cycles

**I'm a bike mechanic based in the Huon Valley, Tasmania.**

### What I do


- Electric bikes

  factory or DIY, new or oldschool. Battery testing, diagnostics, configuration and problem solving.
      
- Service

  maintenance, replacement parts, and adjustments to keep your machine running smoothly

- Repair

  beyond swapping parts, I'm about fixing, modifying and fabricating as required


### How I work

By appointment - You get in touch and we arrange a booking. 
I come to you, and either work on-site or collect-and-return, depending on what's required.
